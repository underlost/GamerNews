Reddit/Hacker News clone written in django/python.

## Notes

- Updated to work with Django 1.6.1
- Designed to run on Heroku.
- As of this writting, the Johnny Cache caching framework has not yet been updated to work with django 1.6. Therefore a slightly modified version is used in vendor/johnny.
- As this is sort of a side project, Im not really testing this local. Im only testing this on Heroku (live), so you may notice an occasional rapid fire of commits being made. I know, Im a horrible, lazy person.
