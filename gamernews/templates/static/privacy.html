	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
	<p>Like most website operators, Gamer News collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Gamer News&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Gamer News&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Gamer News may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

	<p>Gamer News also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Gamer News does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

	<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>Certain visitors to Gamer News&#8217;s websites choose to interact with Gamer News in ways that require Gamer News to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Gamer News gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use submit links to provide a username. In each case, Gamer News collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&#8217;s interaction with Gamer News. Gamer News does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

	<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
	<p>Gamer News may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Gamer News may reveal how many views a particular submission got. However, Gamer News does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

	<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>Gamer News discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Gamer News&#8217;s behalf or to provide services available at Gamer News&#8217;s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Gamer News&#8217;s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Gamer News will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Gamer News discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Gamer News believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Gamer News, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Gamer News website and have supplied your email address, Gamer News may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&#8217;s going on with Gamer News and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Gamer News takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

	<h3>Cookies</h3>

Gamer News uses cookies to help Gamer News identify and track visitors, their usage of Gamer News website, and their website access preferences. Gamer News visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Gamer News&#8217;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Gamer News&#8217;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

	<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
	<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Gamer News may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Gamer News&#8217;s sole discretion.
